# Changelog

All notable changes to `@pi9/todo` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add configurable transient Todo reminders with guarded turn/token cadence, per-run limits, and automatic resets after Todo interactions.
- Add one-shot transient full phased-plan context after successful manual, threshold, or overflow compaction, preserving literal task statuses without changing Pi's compaction summary or session history.

### Changed

- Add spacing below the above-editor Todo widget and refine the provider-facing tool guidance and package documentation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Add a provider-compatible phased planning tool with atomic `set`, `add`, `transition`, and `view` operations, immutable name-addressed tasks, and branch-aware state restoration.
- Add compact and expanded task rendering with phase progress, status styling, completion metadata, live plan updates, and native tool shells.
- Add a persistent configurable widget with focused phase previews, terminal-task summaries, animated activity markers, and flexible placement.
- Add validated global and trusted-project settings for widget presentation, glyph fallback, and tool-output visibility.
