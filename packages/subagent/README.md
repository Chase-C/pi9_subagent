# @pi9/subagent

Delegate focused work from Pi to context-isolated child conversations. The single `subagent` tool provides agent discovery, side-effect-free inventory, asynchronous runs, blocking retrieval, explicit cleanup, recursive delegation, and live progress.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@pi9/subagent
```

## Quick start

Define an agent in `.pi/agents/scout.md`:

```markdown
---
name: scout
description: Read-only codebase reconnaissance
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
tools: read, bash
---

Inspect the repository and return concise, evidence-backed findings.
```

Start a run:

```ts
subagent({
  action: "run",
  tasks: [{ agent: "scout", label: "auth map", prompt: "Find the auth entry points." }]
})
```

`run` is always asynchronous. It returns immediately with two process-local identifiers for each accepted task:

- `conversationId`, a readable adjective-noun identifier such as `quiet-otter`
- `runId`, a readable verb-adverb identifier such as `search-boldly`

Wait for that exact run and retrieve its output with `join`:

```ts
subagent({ action: "join", runIds: ["search-boldly"] })
```

Continue the conversation after it becomes resumable:

```ts
subagent({
  action: "run",
  tasks: [{ conversationId: "quiet-otter", prompt: "Turn those findings into a plan." }]
})
```

## Define agents

Agent markdown is discovered from the user `${PI_AGENT_DIR ?? ~/.pi/agent}/agents` directory and the nearest project `.pi/agents`. Project definitions override same-named user definitions by default.

| Frontmatter | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | Runtime agent name. |
| `description` | yes | Non-blank discovery summary. |
| `model` | no | `provider/model` or an unambiguous model id. |
| `thinking` | no | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. |
| `tools` | no | Comma-separated allowlist; include `subagent` for recursive delegation. |
| `skills` | no | Comma-separated default skills. A spawn-task value replaces this list. |

The body becomes the child system prompt. Spawn tasks require `agent` and `prompt`; `label` is optional, and tasks may override supported execution options such as model, thinking, working directory, and skills. A model requested by either the task or agent definition must resolve; an unknown or malformed value fails that task instead of falling back. When neither specifies a model, the child inherits the parent's model. An explicit task `cwd` is resolved relative to the parent's working directory and must identify an existing directory. Follow-up tasks identify a conversation and provide a prompt; the conversation's agent and execution context remain fixed.

## Tool actions

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `agents` | Discover agent definitions and their resolved defaults. |
| `list` | Return a lightweight inventory of conversations and runs without run output. It is pure: it acknowledges nothing and changes no lifecycle state. |
| `run` | Start one or more well-formed tasks asynchronously and return one ordered outcome per task, including identifiers for accepted tasks and errors for semantic or startup failures. |
| `join` | Block until every explicitly requested exact run settles, then return and acknowledge exactly those runs. There is no timeout. Cancelling `join` stops only the wait; it does not stop the underlying runs. |
| `remove` | Clean up the specified conversations, aborting active work if necessary, deleting resumable child session state, and hiding them from `list`. |

Each task is handled independently after the tool call passes SDK schema validation. Task-level parsing and startup failures—such as a missing agent, an unknown agent, an invalid model, or a missing working directory—return an ordered `{ ok: false, inputIndex, error }` outcome without preventing valid sibling tasks from starting. Invalid outer invocations—including a missing or unknown action, absent or empty tasks, and batch-limit violations—remain global errors. Provider-level schema violations may reject the tool call before execution.

For example, a three-task batch can return a successful start, a task-level failure, and another successful start in input order:

```json
[
  { "ok": true, "inputIndex": 0, "conversationId": "quiet-otter", "runId": "search-boldly" },
  { "ok": false, "inputIndex": 1, "error": "Task must carry exactly one of agent (spawn) or conversationId (resume)." },
  { "ok": true, "inputIndex": 2, "conversationId": "calm-fox", "runId": "inspect-carefully" }
]
```

Rejected tasks receive no `conversationId` or `runId` and do not appear in `list`; only accepted tasks enter the run lifecycle.

A run belongs to one conversation. Spawning creates both; a follow-up creates another run in an existing conversation. Every conversation remains available in the runtime inventory until explicitly removed, including after successful, failed, or interrupted work.

`canResume` becomes true only after a completed run or an interrupted run that preserved its conversation context. It remains false while work is queued or active, and after failures or interruptions that did not preserve context.

`join` is keyed by `runId`, not merely by conversation. A root/top-level join waits for, returns, and acknowledges exactly the requested runs, even when one of their conversations has newer work. A join issued by a child may target only runs spawned anywhere beneath that child's exact owner run; sibling, ancestor, and unrelated runs are rejected.

Only descendants named in an explicit nested join block that caller. Unjoined descendants continue independently and detach when their parent finishes. Nested answers are returned directly to the child that joined them, but their output is omitted from ancestor tree rendering; ancestor views retain lifecycle and identity context without copying target answers. Nested join-attempt history is runtime-local and is not restored after restart or extension reload.

After `remove`, compact terminal run results remain joinable by `runId`, including the aborted result of work that was active when removed, even though the conversation and resumable session state are gone. Use `remove` with conversation identifiers when the whole conversation is no longer needed.

## Capacity and concurrency

Concurrency is shared across the entire recursive delegation tree. `maxConversations` defaults to `100`. Once that many conversations are present, new spawns are rejected until one or more conversations are removed; existing conversations can still be inspected, joined, or cleaned up.

Settings are stored at `${PI_AGENT_DIR ?? ~/.pi/agent}/subagent/settings.json`. Common runtime and display controls are also available through `/subagents settings`.

## Notifications, UI, and lifecycle

Completion notifications concern settled runs that have not yet been acknowledged. Listing inventory does not acknowledge them. Joining a run acknowledges that exact run; cleanup also clears notifications associated with the removed conversations.

`/subagents` opens the conversation, agent, and settings UI. It provides live status and progress, access to completed output, follow-up prompts when `canResume` is true, and explicit conversation cleanup.

The package emits lifecycle updates for queued, started, and completed work. Nested join changes emit `subagent:updated` with `kind: "nestedJoin"` and the owner conversation snapshot; they do not create additional queued, started, or completed milestones. Identifiers, run records, child conversation context, and nested join-attempt history are runtime-local only. They are not restored after a process restart or extension reload.

`run` remains asynchronous regardless of recursive delegation. These join semantics do not change the scope or behavior of `/subagents` or its widget.

## Major-version migration

There is no compatibility layer for the previous lifecycle API.

| Previous term or behavior | New contract |
| --- | --- |
| `foreground` / `background` dispatch | `run` always starts asynchronously; use `join` when blocking retrieval is needed. |
| `results` action | `join` waits for and retrieves an exact run. |
| `sessionId` | Use `conversationId` for conversation lifecycle and `runId` for exact-run retrieval. |
| `retainConversation` | Every conversation remains in the runtime until explicit `remove`. |

## Architecture

- `src/agents.ts` owns agent definitions, discovery, parsing, and requested configuration.
- `src/conversation.ts` and `src/activity.ts` own persistent conversations, exact runs, lifecycle state, and live SDK activity.
- `src/runtime.ts` owns the conversation catalog, joining, scheduling, queue limits, and retained run results; `src/execute.ts` owns child SDK session execution.
- `src/schema.ts` and `src/tool.ts` own provider-facing validation and tool actions.
- `src/notifications.ts`, `src/widget.ts`, and `src/command/` own the three user-facing presentation surfaces.
- `src/settings.ts`, `src/identifiers.ts`, and `src/index.ts` own configuration, runtime-local identifiers, and Pi extension composition respectively.
