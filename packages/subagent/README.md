# @pi9/subagent

Delegate focused work from Pi to context-isolated child conversations. The single `subagent` tool provides agent discovery, side-effect-free inventory, asynchronous runs, blocking retrieval, explicit cleanup, recursive delegation, and live progress.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@pi9/subagent
```

## Quick start

Define an agent in `.pi/agents/scout.md`:

```markdown
---
name: scout
description: Read-only codebase reconnaissance
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
tools: read, bash
---

Inspect the repository and return concise, evidence-backed findings.
```

Start a run:

```ts
subagent({
  action: "run",
  tasks: [{ agent: "scout", label: "auth map", prompt: "Find the auth entry points." }]
})
```

`run` is always asynchronous. It returns immediately with two process-local identifiers for each accepted task:

- `conversationId`, a readable adjective-noun identifier such as `quiet-otter`
- `runId`, a readable verb-adverb identifier such as `search-boldly`

Wait for that exact run and retrieve its output with `join`:

```ts
subagent({ action: "join", runIds: ["search-boldly"] })
```

Continue the conversation after it becomes resumable:

```ts
subagent({
  action: "run",
  tasks: [{ conversationId: "quiet-otter", prompt: "Turn those findings into a plan." }]
})
```

## Define agents

Agent markdown is discovered from the user `${PI_AGENT_DIR ?? ~/.pi/agent}/agents` directory and the nearest project `.pi/agents`. Project definitions override same-named user definitions by default.

| Frontmatter | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | Runtime agent name. |
| `description` | yes | Non-blank discovery summary. |
| `model` | no | `provider/model` or an unambiguous model id. |
| `thinking` | no | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. |
| `tools` | no | Comma-separated allowlist; include `subagent` for recursive delegation. |
| `skills` | no | Comma-separated default skills. A spawn-task value replaces this list. |

The body becomes the child system prompt. Spawn tasks require `agent` and `prompt`; `label` is optional, and tasks may override supported execution options such as model, thinking, working directory, and skills. A model requested by either the task or agent definition must resolve; an unknown or malformed value fails that task instead of falling back. When neither specifies a model, the child inherits the parent's model. An explicit task `cwd` is resolved relative to the parent's working directory and must identify an existing directory. Follow-up tasks identify a conversation and provide a prompt; the conversation's agent and execution context remain fixed.

## Tool actions

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `agents` | Discover agent definitions and their resolved defaults. |
| `list` | Return a lightweight inventory of conversations and runs without run output. It is pure: it acknowledges nothing and changes no lifecycle state. |
| `run` | Start one or more well-formed tasks asynchronously and return one ordered outcome per task, including identifiers for accepted tasks and errors for semantic or startup failures. |
| `join` | Block until each specified exact run settles, then return that run's output or error. There is no timeout. Cancelling `join` stops only the wait; it does not stop the underlying run. |
| `remove` | Clean up the specified conversations, aborting active work if necessary, deleting resumable child session state, and hiding them from `list`. |

A malformed task rejects the entire `run` batch. Once the batch passes schema and task-shape validation, each task starts independently, so semantic or startup failures such as an unknown agent, invalid model, or missing working directory do not prevent valid siblings from starting. Errors in the outer invocation—including a missing or unknown action, absent or empty tasks, and batch-limit violations—also remain global errors.

A run belongs to one conversation. Spawning creates both; a follow-up creates another run in an existing conversation. Every conversation remains available in the runtime inventory until explicitly removed, including after successful, failed, or interrupted work.

`canResume` becomes true only after a completed run or an interrupted run that preserved its conversation context. It remains false while work is queued or active, and after failures or interruptions that did not preserve context.

`join` is keyed by `runId`, not merely by conversation, so a caller always receives the requested run even when that conversation has newer work. After `remove`, compact terminal run results remain joinable by `runId`, including the aborted result of work that was active when removed, even though the conversation and resumable session state are gone. Use `remove` with conversation identifiers when the whole conversation is no longer needed.

## Capacity and concurrency

Concurrency is shared across the entire recursive delegation tree. `maxConversations` defaults to `100`. Once that many conversations are present, new spawns are rejected until one or more conversations are removed; existing conversations can still be inspected, joined, or cleaned up.

Settings are stored at `${PI_AGENT_DIR ?? ~/.pi/agent}/subagent/settings.json`. Common runtime and display controls are also available through `/subagents settings`.

## Notifications, UI, and lifecycle

Completion notifications concern settled runs that have not yet been acknowledged. Listing inventory does not acknowledge them. Joining a run acknowledges that exact run; cleanup also clears notifications associated with the removed conversations.

`/subagents` opens the conversation, agent, and settings UI. It provides live status and progress, access to completed output, follow-up prompts when `canResume` is true, and explicit conversation cleanup.

The package emits lifecycle updates for queued, started, and completed work. Identifiers, run records, and child conversation context are runtime-local only. They are not restored after a process restart or extension reload.

## Major-version migration

There is no compatibility layer for the previous lifecycle API.

| Previous term or behavior | New contract |
| --- | --- |
| `foreground` / `background` dispatch | `run` always starts asynchronously; use `join` when blocking retrieval is needed. |
| `results` action | `join` waits for and retrieves an exact run. |
| `sessionId` | Use `conversationId` for conversation lifecycle and `runId` for exact-run retrieval. |
| `retainConversation` | Every conversation remains in the runtime until explicit `remove`. |

## Architecture

- `src/domain/` owns agents, conversations, runs, lifecycle state, and capabilities.
- `src/runtime/` owns orchestration, queues, limits, notifications, and child execution.
- `src/tool/` owns action handlers and child tool injection.
- `src/command/`, `src/ui/`, and `src/view/` own the overlay, persistent display, and rendering.
